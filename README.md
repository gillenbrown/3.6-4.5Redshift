# rsz_irac

rsz_irac is Python code to estimate redshift of galaxy clusters using ch1 and ch2 data from Spitzer's IRAC instrument. This is done by fitting model red sequences to the cluster, picking the model that best matches the cluster's red sequence. The redshfit of this model red sequence is adopted as the redshift of the cluster.

#### More info is found in the [wiki](https://github.com/gillenbrown/rsz_irac/wiki), which you can access from the sidebar on the right. It contains all the info you will need to know to install the code, get it up and running, and understand the outputs.
