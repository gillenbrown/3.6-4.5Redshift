#
# - name: name of the cluster
#
#   The next few columns contain the redshift info. This
#   done on a per band basis.
# - z: best fit redshift of the cluster
# - ez+: 1 sigma error on the redshift above the best fit
# - ez-: 1 sigma error on the redshift below the best fit
#        Note that these errors assume there is a distinct
#         red sequence, so if there are flags be wary of
#         this value.
# - flag: This column contains info about multiple flags. 
#         Each flag is assigned to a value of 2^n, and 
#         then the numbers are summed together, with the 
#         results being recorded in this column. This 
#         allows for a unique identifier for each 
#         combination of flags.
#         1: Not much clustering. The objects marked as 
#            red sequence members weren't centrally 
#            concentrated.
#         2: Possible double red sequence. There are two
#            maxima in the likelihood of redshift.
#         4: Indistinct red sequence. The red sequence
#            isn't clean.
