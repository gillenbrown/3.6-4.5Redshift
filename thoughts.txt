Call the program from the command line
parse the config file
find each file in the directory




General ideas:
don't worry about this being importable, since it is only a command line tool.

Have a lightweight executable file, which uses the meat of the code, which is in another folder.

make a generalized data object, which supports asymmetric errors.
